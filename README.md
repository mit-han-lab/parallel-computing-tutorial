# Matrix Multiplication Optimization Techniques

This repository introduces several optimization techniques that can be applied to matrix multiplication. The techniques include loop unrolling, loop reordering, loop tiling, multithreading, SIMD programming, and CUDA programming. Each technique is implemented in a separate source file (*.cpp inside [src/](src/)) and all techniques use the common header file [matmul.h](include/matmul.h). In addition, we also provide a benchmark.cpp and a Makefile to compile and benchmark the different matrix multiplication implementations.

## Learning Resources
If your want to learn more about optimization techniques of efficient deep learning, please check out lectures of [TinyML and Efficient Deep Learning Computing](https://efficientml.ai/).

## Directory Structure
Here is an outline of the main files and directories:
```ccs
├── src
│   ├── loop_unrolling.cpp
│   ├── loop_reordering.cpp
│   ├── loop_tiling.cpp
│   ├── naive.cpp
│   ├── multithreading.cpp
│   ├── SIMD_programming.cpp
│   └── cuda_programming.cpp
├── include

├── benchmark.cpp
└── Makefile
```

## Directory Structure

### Prerequisites
To compile and run the examples, you will need:

* A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
* CUDA Toolkit (optional, only if you want to enable CUDA programming.)

### Compilation
To compile the code, navigate to the repository root and execute:

```bash
make -j
```
This will produce an executable named `benchmark`.

### Running the Benchmarks
To run the benchmark, execute:

```bash
./benchmark
```

The benchmark will run matrix multiplication using all techniques and output the time taken by each technique.
